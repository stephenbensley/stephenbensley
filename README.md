# Hello

I am a retired software engineer building apps as a hobby. All of my apps target the Apple ecosystem because those are the only devices I own. All of my apps are free in every sense of the word:

- The source code is released under a permissive free software license, the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
- The apps are free to download and contain no in-app purchases or subscriptions.
- The apps are free of ads.
- The apps are free of tracking, data mining, and any other activity that would impact your privacy.

These apps are a gift to the world. I hope someone finds them enjoyable or useful.
